To view Processing-JS Programs offline:
Click on the ZIP tab at the top of the page. This archive will automatically pack itself into a ZIP file which will download into your default downloads folder. 
After UnZipping the file into the folder of your choice, open the index.html page with your Web Browser and you can view a number of sample Programs embedded in Web Pages.

Creating your own files for offline viewing is relatively easy if you understand a little basic HTML.
Copy your Program code and open the template.js file. Paste your program into the designated area. Save As and name the file programName.js .
Now open the Template.html page, scroll down to the bottom, and replace the name that refers to template.js with programName.js . 
You may also change the title of the page etc. if you like. Save As and rename your Template to programName.html. 
That should be it :) if you open programName.html in your web browser, you should be able to view your Program offline.
