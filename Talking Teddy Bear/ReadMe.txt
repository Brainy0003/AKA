These are a collection of MP3 files made to be used with an MP3 player Teddy Bear.
The idea being: instead of teaching kid's to memorize a lot of inane nursery rhymes from the Victorian age, using simple repetition instead, a child can absorb useful information such as the Multiplication Tables at an age when their mind is most absorptive: around 5 years old, when a child will generally learn around 10,000 new words in a years time. Wouldn't it be great if those words weren't things like McDonalds and Pokemon?
When I showed one of the Talking Teddy Bears to friends, one of the first things someone suggested was that it would be cool if it was interactive. That got me thinking that with the availability of micro computers like the Raspberry Pi and handheld devices like Android, it would no longer take millions of dollars of R & D to develop such a concept. Now one could make a robotic toy which can customize content based on the age and learning rate of the individual.
At the moment I am working wholeheartedly on making Processing-JS tutorials for the Khan Academy Computer Science department, so this is temporarily on the back burner. However I would gladly refocus my efforts if I saw that their was any interest in developing this further.
