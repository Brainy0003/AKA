<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the glorious tradition 
  of writing programming tutorials, we would naturally tell you to simply go to 
  the command prompt and compile it using your favorite C# compiler and Voila! 
  <b>:)</b><br>
  That of course assumes that you are a seasoned professional programmer with 
  years of experience at working with Functions and Classes and that you probably 
  have a degree in computer science and are merely migrating over to C# from one 
  of the many programming languages you already have under your belt.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are not going to assume 
  any of that.<br>
  We will assume you have no idea what a compiler even is, or a Command Prompt, 
  or that you know what DOS is, or even what an Operating System is, for the most 
  part. If that bugs any of you computer nerds, get the #%*&amp;^$! out of the 
  Getting Started category and go find some more technical pages elsewhere.<br>
  We WILL assume you are using a PC for this page. This covers about 90% of the 
  computers out there. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First of all, in order 
  to turn your first code sample into an application, you will need a <a href="../compilers.htm">Compiler</a>.<br>
  The compiler is an application which will turn your cryptic code into an even 
  more indeciperable stream of 1s and 0s which your computer can understand. See 
  the chapter called &quot;What Is A Computer?&quot; which you will find in practically 
  every book or tutorial on programming ever written, along with several other 
  useless chapters devoted to the author trying to numb your brain with virtually 
  everything they know about computer history.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The truth is, the reason 
  why programmers tell you to use your favorite compiler instead of just telling 
  you how to do it, is that different compilers each do it a little differently.<br>
  So the right way to do it, is basically just have a separate &quot;Hello World&quot; 
  tutorial for each compiler. Instead of just coming out and admitting that they 
  are too lazy to write a separate tutorial for each of the 3 or 4 compilers they 
  maybe know how to use, they generally just pronounce it as &quot;simple&quot; 
  and adopt a go-figure-it-out-yourself attitude.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, so first thing you 
  do is run right out and blow a few thousand on a state-of-the-art C# compiler, 
  then invest a few grand more to go to school for programming, and get hundreds 
  of dollars worth of books and maybe a nice shelf to put them on and you're ready 
  to go. Right?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Or to save wear and tear 
  on tennis shoes you could just download the free Visual C# Express compiler 
  from Microsoft and take advantage of free programming tutorials all over the 
  internet. <br>
  You need a little more time to think about it? <br>
  The free command line compiler also comes with the .Net Framework SDK. I had 
  it on my computer for years and didn't even know it.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, so here is the list 
  of commercial C# compilers you can buy:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why bother?</font> </li>
  <li><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/csharp.shtml">Free 
    C# Compilers:</a> Yay!<br>
    </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you have installed 
  one of the recommended free compilers you are ready to compile your own programs 
  from the Command Prompt.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are a number of separate 
  <a href="../index.htm#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> tutorials on this 
  site with the classic Hello World example depending on which compiler you have 
  chosen.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="ConsoleApplication"></a>Beginners 
  are recommended to start by making simple Console Applications for the basic 
  beginning examples. A Console Application is not something you run on a game 
  console like the Xbox or something. Basically a Console Application is something 
  which you would run on old school computers which didn't have a Windows type 
  operating system. A Console application is pretty simple, it maybe has some 
  code which does something like Print some words to the screen. If you want an 
  application which you can run on Windows, you have to include a bunch of extra 
  code in there which communicates with the Windows operating system. So to keep 
  our first code samples as minimal as possible, we will start with simple applications 
  which you run from the Command Line.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have installed Visual 
  C# Express, it comes with a nice IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) 
  which is supposed to make life easier for authoring code and organizing your 
  projects. In this tutorial, we actually have you ignore your nice shiny IDE, 
  and instead we use a dinky little application that sits in a side folder that 
  came along Visual C# Express called csc. Once you get used to it, this is actually 
  a much faster way of doing quick little applications than using the IDE. I recommend 
  doing the first 20 or 30 tutorial examples using the Command Line Compiler, 
  then have a look at <a href="index.htm#VisualConsole">Compiling a Console Application 
  using the Visual C# IDE</a>, until you think you have a feel for the C# language 
  and are ready to begin wrapping your head around writing applications that will 
  run on Windows.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9900"><a name="LocateCompiler"></a>Locating 
  The Command Line Compiler</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">OK, assuming you have already 
  installed Visual C# Express or the .Net Framework SDK from Microsoft, you should 
  now have the ability to author <i>Console</i> Applications, which you can run 
  from the <i>Command Line</i>.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"> 
  To locate the compiler, go to Start / Search and locate the file called csc.exe</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Open the folder containing 
  the application csc.exe<br>
  You'll want to select and copy the path to the application. Mine looks like 
  this:<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">C:\WINNT\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727</font></font></p>
<table width="75%" border="0" bgcolor="#FFFF99" align="center" cellpadding="10">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="+1"><b>Don't 
        see the Path? </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">There 
        are different ways to do that depending on how you have your operating 
        system set up. If you click one time on the application, you should see 
        the path appear in the address bar of the folder and you can copy it right 
        out of there. Some versions of Windows, like Windows XP may have the address 
        bar turned off by default. You have to turn the address bar on in the 
        folder preferences for your operating system. As a programmer, you will 
        need quick access to the path of your files.</font> </p>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you try to run the application 
  you will get an error message. This is the type of application which accepts 
  <i>Command Line Arguments</i>, meaning you don't just double click on the application 
  and run it, like you would with normal Windows type applications. Instead what 
  you do is you type some commands and hit Enter, and the application will execute 
  whatever you tell it to do. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">First we have to <i>Set 
  the Path</i> so Windows know where to find it.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF9900"><a name="SetPath"></a>Setting 
  the Path</font></h3>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This section is informative 
  and technical. <font color="#FF9900"><b>FYI</b></font> <a href="index.htm#AddPath">Beginners 
  can skip over this chapter</a> if you like.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing you could do 
  is put your code file in the same folder as csc.exe. Then to compile it, all 
  you would have to do is: from the Command Prompt, go to that folder and type:<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">csc NameOfFile.cs</font> <br>
  and it would compile your code into an application called <font color="#0000FF"><br>
  NameOfFile.exe</font><br>
  Pretty simple. However, you probably don't want to store your files in the same 
  folder as your application. There's already a ton of files in there that the 
  compiler needs, so it will get confusing pretty fast.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As long as you start in 
  the same directory as csc.exe, you can invoke it by just typing <font color="#0000FF">csc</font><br>
  If you start from another directory like My Documents, you have to invoke the 
  compiler by specifying the path to it before the name. <br>
  For instance, if I were starting from the main C: Drive, to invoke the compiler, 
  I would enter:<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">\WINNT\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc FileName.cs</font><br>
  This will compile FileName.cs into FileName.exe as long as it's in the same 
  folder as csc.exe.<br>
  Likewise you can specify the path to the directory where your file is stored. 
  Say my C# code file was in My Documents:<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">\Documents and Settings\UserName\My Documents\FileName.cs</font><br>
  Now we have a long-ass command that looks like this:<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">\WINNT\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\csc \Documents 
  and Settings\UserName\My Documents\FileName.cs</font><br>
  Rather than having to go around adding these long pathnames every time we want 
  to call the compiler, we can actually tell Windows where to find the application 
  csc.exe one time, and from then on we can simply call csc by name regardless 
  of what directory we are starting in. </font></p>
