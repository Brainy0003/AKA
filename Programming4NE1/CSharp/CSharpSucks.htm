<p><font size="+1">Microsoft's new C# programming language has been around since 
  2000 now, and they are baffled as to why people just don't seem to be embracing 
  their marvelous new language. They have become so desperate to get programmers 
  using C#, that they have released Visual C# Express <b>free</b> for a year.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">In the book &quot;Windows Forms Programming in C#&quot;, Chris 
  Sells, says &quot;It's ironic that the temporary dip in the economy has caused 
  folks to avoid anything new just when .Net has come along to deliver significant 
  reductions in time to market and cost while simultaneously increasing code quality&quot;. 
  Is that why they think nobody is buying their crap? The Economy?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I'm sure the fact that Microsoft is one of the most backstabbing 
  and unscrupulous companies on the face of the planet has nothing to do with 
  it. The very foundation of Windows was stolen by Bill Gates from his employer, 
  something I consider to be the lowest of the low. How about Microsoft practically 
  forcing Netscape out of business for no good reason, stomping on RealPlayer 
  with their piece of crap Windows Media Player and then making them look like 
  the bad guys when they basically had to fight to stay alive? I remenber I was 
  trying to learn SMIL at the time, which was supported and promoted by RealPlayer. 
  Then one day I go to open an SMIL file which was normally associated with ReaPlayer 
  and Windows Media Player launches, and it couldn't even read the SMIL files! 
  Now Microsoft is trying to get everybody hyped over XAML which is basically 
  a ripoff of what SMIL would have been had Bill Gates not stuck his greedy fingers 
  into the pie. Then of course, they will be pushing Sparkle which is clearly 
  an attempt to rip off Macromedia Flash. The .Net Framework is Microsoft's attempt 
  to replace JAVA and they pretty much stole the whole C# foundation from Borland 
  by offering their top programmers million dollar a year salaries. They also 
  don't pay a dime of taxes through some loophole where their main offices are 
  in Malasia or somewhere and they overcharge themselves for their own services. 
  But hey, this is America. Bill Gates is a mutherfucking hero, right?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Seriously you guys, don't you think your brains might get a 
  little more oxygen if you TOOK YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR FUCKIN ASSES!?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I will <b>NEVER</b> buy your stupid Visual Studio.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I am sick of your carrot on a stick tactics of: &quot;Look 
  we have Video!&quot; &quot;Look over here, we have 3D!&quot;.<br>
  Bragging about the fact that now developers don't have to concern themselves 
  with the details of garbage collection.<br>
  Q: Why did we have to wipe Microsoft's ass for the last 15 years in the FIRST 
  PLACE? <br>
  Back in the days of BASIC you could learn a new programming language in a few 
  weeks. Now estimates for the time it takes to learn C# are about 6 months. How 
  many lifetimes do you think people have to waste learning Latin, only to find 
  it's obsolete by the time you finish learning it? Now you have to go out and 
  learn yet another language, and the rate at which new programming languages 
  comes out increases exponentially every year.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">They keep trying to entice people into thinking that if you 
  blow good money on yet another one of their indecipherable piles of gobbledegook, 
  that you too will have the ability to make sizzling 3D, Video, streaming web 
  applications, etc. but they haven't even made any attempt whatsoever to make 
  it any easier to do any of these things. In fact, it get's more and more complicated 
  every year. <br>
  In this day and age of technology, it shouldn't take a goddamn college degree 
  just to get a cube to rotate on the screen!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Let's say I wanted to do what I would consider to be the most 
  rudimentary graphics application in the world: Make A Dot. It literally took 
  me days to find an answer to this simple question: &quot;How do I draw a Dot 
  using C#?&quot;. I searched all over the web looking for an answer to this simple 
  question, and found the exact same question posted by dozens of other sincere 
  beginners. Invariably, their questions would receive all kinds of smartass replies 
  from head-up-their-ass programmers like &quot;Why would you want to draw a dot?&quot;, 
  &quot;Did you mean you want to draw a pixel or a point?&quot;, &quot;Go look 
  on CodeGuru&quot;, &quot;Buy my Book&quot;, etc. While it seemed to me that 
  I understood the question perfectly, trying to get the point across to these 
  dipshit programmers was about as futile as trying to communicate with a blind 
  person using sign language.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">You feel like you're trying to talk to the comic book store 
  owner on the Simpsons: &quot;Well, obviously a newbie such as yourself needs 
  to go back to high school algebra, and you certainly don't belong on this forum!&quot; 
  They can't just come out and admit that either they don't know off the top of 
  their heads and are too lazy to look it up, or that they do know, but aren't 
  telling you, or that they aren't about to have wasted 12 years of college learning 
  how to make a cube rotate to go around giving that information to just anyone. 
  No, they have to belittle you with ignorant comments.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I have yet to find a book on C# that doesn't include the author 
  saying something to the effect of: &quot;I will assume that you already have 
  years of experience with C++ and Java and are familiar with working with Functions 
  and Class Inheritance, etc&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">C# tutorials assume you are familiar with C++. C++ tutorials 
  assume you know C, and C tutorials assume you are a computer science major. 
  The inappropriately titled book &quot;C# for Dummies&quot; should have, in all 
  respects been called &quot;C# for experienced C++ Programmers&quot;. <br>
  OK, so let's say you're just getting started in programming and you want to 
  learn C. You go out and get a book on C, and the first half of the book is all 
  about how to configure the graphics on your 286 using DOS. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The code samples in Chris Sell's book &quot;Windows Forms Programming 
  in C#&quot; are incomplete. The author assumes you are more than familiar with 
  namespaces and using directives and classes and sees fit to leave those parts 
  out of the code. After limping through the first chapter which seems to assume 
  that you already are pretty familiar with Visual Studio as well as compiling 
  applications from the Command Prompt, Chapter 2 starts out with some longer 
  code examples. To save typing, you can download the code samples off the web. 
  However, rather than create a separate file for each exercise, the author decided 
  to save himself a little extra work and just throw all of the examples in chapter 
  2 into one big Solution file. Like every other code sample I have ever downloaded 
  which takes up more than 10 separate pages, there are errors when you try to 
  compile it in Visual C#. I suppose that's supposed to entice me to want to run 
  right out and purchase Visual Studio. Yeah, that'll be the day!</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Fuck Visual Studio! When are those dipshits at Microsoft going 
  to get off their asses and make Visual Game Editor?<br>
  I'm tired of hearing the same excuses over and over: &quot;You can't make a 
  generic Game Editor because there are different types of games!&quot; Oh, really? 
  How many different types? A couple of Million? Hardly! It is clear to me that 
  80% of the market wants to make First Person Shooter games. There are companies 
  like Caligari who are working on an EZ editor for making FPS games, but they 
  are crappy programmers! Look Microsoft, if you're going to go around stealing 
  everybody's software ideas, why don't you have a look at DarkBasic? Those people 
  are assholes. You have my permission to rip them off!<br>
  If I wanted to make a cube in DarkBasic all I would have to write is something 
  to this effect:<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">Make Cube 50, 50</font><br>
  That's it. No using directives, no namespaces, no classes. That is the entire 
  code. Let's say I want to set the refresh rate:<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">FPS 30</font><br>
  How about this one:</font></p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellpadding="6" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td><font size="+1"><font color="#0000FF">Make Dot 20, 20</font></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="+1">Now THAT is a frigging programming language! Unfortunately, 
  their implementation is full of bugs.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Here would be the equivalent of the above program written in 
  C#:</font></p>
<table width="75%" border="0" cellpadding="6" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#0000FF" size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Windows.Forms; </font></pre>
      <pre><font color="#0000FF" size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">namespace Draw_Dot
{
     public partial class DrawDot : Form
     {
         static void Main()
         {
         Application.Run(new DrawDot());
         }
                 protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs pe)
                 {
                  Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(50, 30, 1, 1);
                  SolidBrush lBrush = new SolidBrush(Color.Black);
                  pe.Graphics.FillRectangle(lBrush, rect);
                 }</font></pre>
      <pre>
<font color="#0000FF" size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">         }
}</font></pre>
      <pre></pre>

  I'm sure the guys at Microsoft get a Woody every time the computer prints the 
  value they expected to the screen, but people in the real world want Video and 
  3D Graphics and Peer to Peer Internet Gaming! Without a fucking college degree! 
  That's YOUR job.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Yeah, so most of the people want FPS games, then there's a 
  pretty good sector that want RPG games, then there's simple tile based sprite 
  games and.... hmm, that's about it. I swear to god you guys, you could make 
  about a dozen different game templates and that would cover about 98% of the 
  world's game programming needs for the most part. We're sick of hearing your 
  fucking excuses! The world is tired of you trying to shove shit we never wanted 
  in the first place down our throats.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I filled out one of Microsoft's surveys recently and they were 
  asking dumb questions like:<br>
  &quot;What is your level of trust in Microsoft?&quot; and &quot;How much has 
  this recent pseudo-attempt to pretend to listen to customers changed the way 
  you feel about Microsoft?&quot; So, it is clear that Microsoft is waking up 
  to the fact that people are tired of their shit. But I will tell you flat out: 
  Microsoft could buy me a goddamn house in Beverly Hills and it wouldn't change 
  the fact that I would still think that they're a bunch of backstabbing snakes. 
  You're goddamned right, Visual C# SHOULD be free. So should LiveMeeting. It 
  should be built into Messenger. You've already made billions off ripping everybody 
  off. It's the LEAST you can do. And while I'm ranting, when are you lazy fucks 
  going to get around to making a free .x modeling tool? With 3D paint and texturing.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I went to one of those MSDN events recently where they were 
  showing off their new Mobile 5.0 SDK and everybody was asking the same questions: 
  &quot;How do you make games on it&quot; Of course if you ask somebody from Microsoft 
  this question, all you get is a vacant stare. They give you this dumb look like, 
  &quot;Why the fuck would anybody want to make games on a Pocket PC?&quot; or 
  &quot;I've heard this questions so many hundreds of times, I'm not even hearing 
  it any more&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I attended one of the Microsoft sponsored webcasts by DigiPen 
  called &quot;Beginning 2D Game Programming using C#&quot;, and dozens of people 
  kept asking the same &quot;dumb&quot; question: &quot;Can you write XBox games 
  with C#?&quot; Of course, since my wife works in the game industry, I know the 
  answer to this one: &quot;Yes, if you've got over $100,000 to buy the special 
  console needed to write them on!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">So my next question to Microsoft is obvious: &quot;When are 
  you going to get off your lazy asses and make a version of the XBox which allows 
  users to make and play their own games?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I had an idea for a Vector Based Animation program 20 years 
  ago, and I went to Adobe to try to convince them to make my dream. Basically 
  they said &quot;Thanks, but no thanks. We only make tools for &quot;professionals&quot; 
  &quot;. So I went to Macromedia. My pleas fell on deaf ears. But this time I 
  wasn't going to take no for an answer. I basically launched an all-out assault 
  on Macromedia, calling them constantly, talking to anybody I could find that 
  worked there, walking into their main offices and screaming loud enough so everybody 
  in the facility could hear me. Eventually, they got off their asses and got 
  around to making Flash. It was a toy I wanted and my perception at the time 
  was that they were the only company in town that had both the ability and the 
  desire to make something like what I envisioned. Unfortunately, they took my 
  idea and went way off into left field with it. My original idea was for an application 
  which would make it easy for any child to make simple animations and computer 
  games. This has been my life's ambition. What they ended up with was the kitchen 
  sink, which included audio and raster graphics and video and everything under 
  the sun. In my dream, you would combine all of the separate elements using SMIL. 
  The vector animation part would have been a separate component. I see that now 
  Microsoft is coming around to this way of thinking with Sparkle and XAML. But 
  they have a long way to go to make it intuitive and easy enough for a child 
  to use. A long, long way. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1">I maintain that I basically whined Flash into existence. If 
  I have to piss and moan till somebody gets off their butt and makes a usable 
  Game IDE, so be it.</font></p>
