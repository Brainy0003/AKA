<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="+1">If your first coding 
  attempt compiled successfully on the first try, you are one lucky bastard!<br>
  Generally your code isn't just going to compile right the first time, unless 
  you are the most unbelievably accurate and organized person around .<br>
  Most of the time, you will have to debug your code a bit.<br>
  If your first code example did compile succesfully, let's mess it up a bit. 
  Remove one of the semicolons and compile again. You will get a list of one or 
  more errors.<br>
  When you do, it will give you an error number, followed by the line number where 
  the error occurred, and a brief description of the type of error. When this 
  happens, look at the number. Read it out loud. Read what the error message actually 
  says, then check the line number and go back and see if you can spot your error. 
  While those numbers don't mean much to you now, before long you will begin to 
  recognize various error messages. Soon you will look and see Error 1702 and 
  intuitively know that you forgot to add a semicolon or whatever. Some errors 
  can cause a whole list of errors down the line and you may think it's completely 
  messed up, when all along maybe you had a colon instead of a semicolon, or a 
  period instead of a comma.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="+1">Note: that just 
  because the compiler says the problem is on one line, it may be on the line 
  before, or somewhere in the vicinity. This is just where the compiler ran into 
  a glitch. But hopefully that will get you in the general area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="+1">Take a moment to 
  try a few different things to your code and observe the error messages. Try 
  leaving out opening or closing brackets. Try a colon instead of a semicolon, 
  etc.. </font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="+1">Think of bugs in 
  your code as a challenge to your intellect. A puzzle to be solved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="+1">Note: in Notepad 
  you can tell what line number you are on by going to View / Status bar. Insert 
  your cursor and scroll up and down using the arrow keys. The line number appears 
  in the bar at the bottom.</font></p>
