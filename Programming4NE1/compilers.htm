<h1 align="center"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> <font color="#FF9900">Free 
  Compilers</font></font></h1>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">To get started, first you 
  will need a <i>Compiler</i>, an application which turns all your cryptic code 
  into an even more indecipherable stream of 1s and 0s only your computer can 
  understand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">One way to begin programming 
  is to go out and buy an expensive compiler, then go out and buy a bunch of pricey 
  books, then maybe throw some more money at an overpriced school. Another way 
  is to get a free command line compiler and take advantage of reams of free code 
  samples all over the internet. You need more time to think about it?</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">I just went on the internet 
  and typed &quot;free compilers&quot; in a search engine and found a number of 
  links to free programs which will turn your code into programs. Here's a link.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#FF9900">Free compilers:</font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>

  </font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">I tried the free Visual C++ 
  download from Microsoft and found that none of the tutorials I could find on 
  the web for Visual C++ were compatible, mostly because of changes to the interface. 
  This is Visual C++ <i>Express</i> and not only were there no tutorials yet on 
  the web, but a lot of the built in help feature had broken links, all the help 
  seemed to assume you are an experienced programmer or merely migrating from 
  Visual C++ 6 and was extremely technical and there was no &quot;help for beginner's&quot; 
  feature, so although you can still compile your programs with Visual C++ O.K. 
  from the command line, I ended up using <a href="http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html">Borland's 
  free command line compiler</a> first. Which worked fine.<br>
  I even wrote Microsoft complaining that their &quot;free&quot; software was 
  useless without some form of Getting Started. A few days later they posted a 
  few Getting Started videos! I am a big advocate of squeeky wheel development. 
  People are weird when it comes to computers. If they buy a new computer and 
  it doesn't work right, they blame themselves. If they get some software and 
  the manual is incomprehensible, they sit there and blame it on their own inability 
  to comprehend something which is too technical. Not me, boy. I get on the phone 
  and insist on talking to someone in a position of power and tell them they need 
  to go back and write something in plain English, and shit get's done.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">O.K. so let's get our favorite 
  caffeinated beverage and some pizza or something, because this next sequence 
  may take a bit. Feel free to read ahead in the appropriate Getting Started sections 
  while the applications are downloading. Whatever you do, don't sit there like 
  a dolt and watch the download progress bar like I always do.</font></p>

  you want to get both the free Visual C++ and Visual C#, I think you may want 
  to<br>
  </font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">install <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualC/default.aspx">free 
  Visual C++ Express</a> first. Otherwise it may tell you to uninstall a bunch 
  of other stuff. Then<br>
  install <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp/">free 
  Visual C# Express</a>. Then if you intend to write Windows programs:<br>
  install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=eba0128f-a770-45f1-86f3-7ab010b398a3&DisplayLang=en">Microsoft 
  Platform SDK</a> ( Software Developer's Kit ). <br>
  Next if you want 3D or Graphics or Sound, you may want to <br>
  install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7d29004e-7a8d-4f0a-b199-6a740d8f27bb&displaylang=en">DirectX 
  SDK</a>. If you want to do any Database programming, you may want to grab <br>
  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=220549b5-0b07-4448-8848-dcc397514b41&displaylang=en">free 
  SQL Server</a>. You may also need the .Net Framework runtime for who know's 
  what, but it comes with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fe6f2099-b7b4-4f47-a244-c96d69c35dec&DisplayLang=en">.Net 
  Framework SDK</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">With that little arsenal, 
  you should be able to program just about anything. You will need to tell Visual 
  C++ where to locate the SDKs, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. 
  For now you should be totally set up to start programming simple applications 
  which you can run from the command line.</font></p>
