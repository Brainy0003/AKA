<p><font size="+1">This is the construct. This is where we will build our first 
  program. Save it as <font color="#0000FF">MyFile.cs</font><br>
  Every C++ program consists of one or more functions. At least one of these functions 
  <u>must</u> be named main. In this case we only have one function: to return 
  an integer value to the computer. In this case a value of 0, which will terminate 
  the program. If you run this program you won't see anything happen, it will 
  just run and quit. It is like a blank page</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Right, so for a first project we want to do something simple 
  like print the word &quot;Hello&quot; to the screen.<br>
  If this were BASIC you would simply write:</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">print &quot;Hello&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pretty straightforward. Of course in their efforts to make 
  everything as mind numbingly complicated as possible, we don't just go print 
  hello in C++. Nooooooooo. We have to send a whole bunch of complicated-ass instructions 
  to the computer every time we want to do a simple thing like say &quot;Hi&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">To get an idea what I'm talking about, open another Notepad, 
  go to the Includes folder of your compiler, and open the file called stdio.h<br>
  ( Borland/BCC55/Includes/stdio.h )<br>
  this is the Standard Input Output header file that handles a whole bunch of 
  the commands associated with inputting and outputting text on the computer. 
  Imagine having to type up something like this every time you wanted to do a 
  simple thing like print &quot;Yo&quot; to the screen.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">OK now picture this: you're a programmer writing these endlessly 
  long-ass code commands over and over and over. Eventually you get fed up with 
  typing the SAME THING all the time and instead make a file which contains all 
  of these &quot;frequent phrases&quot;. Now whenever you want to make a new program, 
  you just copy the long, tedious part out of one document and paste it into your 
  code.<br>
  After time, you end up with maybe 100 different applications on your hard drive, 
  each containing the exact same page long bit of code.<br>
  One day you say to yourself &quot;This is stupid. Instead of having the exact 
  same chunk of code residing in 100 different places on my hard drive. What if 
  instead I stored the reusable part of code in it's own separate file? Then when 
  I want to include that bit in my code, I could just make a pointer to it.&quot; 
  Like this:</font></p>
<table width="75%" border="1" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#0000FF" size="+1">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</font></pre>
      <pre><font color="#0000FF" size="+1">int main ( void ) 
{ 
printf ( &quot;Hello&quot; ) ; 
return 0 ; 
}
</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font size="+1">Now what we have effectively done, is include the entire contents 
  of the file stdio.h. When the compiler turns our code into an application, it 
  will include everything it needs from stdio.h as if it were part of our code.<br>
  This is called a <i>header</i> file, signified by the . h extension and goes 
  at the head of our code.<br>
  Inside the Standard Input Output header file are a number of different <i>functions</i> 
  you can call upon. In this case, we are calling the function <i>printf</i>. 
  Whatever is inside the ( ) is the <i>parameter</i> that is passed to the function. 
  In this case the parameter we are passing is a string of text, signified by 
  the quotation marks. Whatever is inside the &quot; &quot; will be printed to 
  the screen .</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Right, let's try to print some thing on two lines:</font></p>
