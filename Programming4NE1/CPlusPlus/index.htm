<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">I tried the free Visual C++ 
  download from Microsoft and found that none of the tutorials I could find on 
  the web for Visual C++ were compatible, mostly because of changes to the interface. 
  This is Visual C++ <i>Express</i> and not only were there no tutorials yet on 
  the web, but a lot of the built in help feature had broken links, all the help 
  seemed to assume you are an experienced programmer and was extremely technical 
  and there was no &quot;help for beginner's&quot; feature, so although you can 
  still compile your programs with Visual C++ O.K. from the command line, I ended 
  up using Borland's free command line compiler, so I recommend you download that 
  one as well to follow along.</font></p>

<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Once you have installed your 
  free Borland compiler we will go straight into the forbidden zone known as DOS. 
  First you want to open your Command Prompt.<br>
  Assuming you are on a PC and have no idea what a Command Prompt or DOS is:<br>
  On Windows, go to Start / All Programs / Accesories / Command Prompt. Remember 
  to click on the Compilers button in your menu bar to return to this tutorial. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">If you blow the window up 
  to full screen size you'll get an idea of what computers looked like before 
  there was Windows, everything was done at the text level, and that's where we're 
  going to be spending a lot of time from now on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Depending on your computer 
  you may see something a little different, mine looks like this:</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><img src="../Borland/images/command_prompt.jpg" width="705" height="486"></font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">We want to start at the root 
  directory like this:</font></p>
<p><img src="../Borland/images/command_prompt_C.jpg" width="833" height="544"></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">C: represents your main hard 
  drive. Yours may be a different letter, D: perhaps.<br>
  If yours already looks like this, that's fine. If yours looks more like mine 
  with a couple of folder names after it<br>
  Type the following:<br>
  <font size="+2" color="#0000FF">cd..</font></font><font size="+2" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> 
  </font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
  and hit Enter. (That's CD period period)<br>
  This should move you up one Directory:</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><img src="../Borland/images/command_prompt2.jpg" width="833" height="544"></font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Type <font color="#0000FF">CD..</font> 
  again and hit Enter. This should move you up another level.<br>
  Continue entering CD.. until you can go no higher. You have reached the top 
  level of your Hard Drive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><img src="../Borland/images/command_prompt3.jpg" width="833" height="544"></font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Type<br>
  <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">dir</font><br>
  and hit Enter.<br>
  This should display the contents of your hard drive:</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><img src="../Borland/images/command_prompt4.jpg" width="833" height="544"></font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">You can see there may be one 
  or two files and a number of folders, or Directories. <br>
  If you have installed the Borland command line compiler, you should see a Directory 
  named &quot;Borland&quot;.<br>
  Type<br>
  <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">cd borland</font><br>
  This will take you to the Borland directory, or folder.<br>
  Enter <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">dir</font> to display the contents of 
  that directory. There is only one directory contained therein: BCC55.<br>
  Enter <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">cd bcc55</font>, then <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">dir</font> 
  to show the contents of the BCC55 directory.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Create a new Directory from 
  the Command Prompt</font></h3>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Make a directory to store 
  your code in:<br>
  Type<br>
  <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">mkdir Projects</font><br>
  and hit Enter. This creates a new folder called Projects. Type <font color="#0000FF" size="+1">dir</font> 
  to verify that the new directory is there.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Open specified directory</font></h3>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">The Borland compiler is in 
  the directory called Bin (short for Binaries).<br>
  To open the Bin directory:<br>
  Type<br>
  <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">cd../bin</font><br>
  This will take you up one directory, and then down again all in one command. 
  The command prompt should indicate that you are in the Bin directory. Type <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">dir</font> 
  to view the contents.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Run a program from the Command 
  Prompt</font></h3>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">The Borland C++ compiler application 
  is called bcc32.exe. You execute the program by typing a command from the prompt, 
  such as telling it to compile a piece of code for you. You do not actually run 
  the application. If you do try to run the application, it will dump a list of 
  commands to the screen. These are the various commands you use to tell the compiler 
  what to do.<br>
  To run the Borland compiler:<br>
  Type<br>
  <font size="+1" color="#0000FF">bcc32</font><br>
  and hit Enter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><img src="../Borland/images/borland_commands.jpg" width="834" height="545"></font></p>
<h3><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Create your first code</font></h3>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"> Type<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">notepad hello.cpp</font><br>
  Notepad opens and ask if it's O.K. to create a new file. Just hit Enter.<br>
  Type the following code. Yes, actually type it. Don't just copy it out of the 
  box . Put your lazy fingers on the keys and type.</font></p>
<table width="75%" border="1" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td> 
      <pre><font color="#0000FF">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</font></pre>
      <pre><font color="#0000FF">int main ( void )
{
         printf ( &quot;Hello&quot; ) ;
return 0 ;
}
</font></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Go to File / Save As<br>
  Save the file hello.cpp in the Projects folder you created earlier located at 
  My Computer / Hard Drive ( C: / Borland / BCC55 / Projects ).</font></p>
<h3><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Compile the code</font></h3>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Now copy the next command 
  if you like: (highlight the text in the box and go to Edit / Copy in your brower 
  menu)</font></p>
<table width="75%" border="1" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">bcc32 -If:\Borland\BCC55\Include 
      -Lf:\Borland\BCC55\Lib -n\Borland\BCC55\Projects \Borland\BCC55\Projects\hello.cpp 
      </font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Of course that's assuming 
  you are using the suggested Borland compiler and you installed it in the default 
  folder as I did, which is the main hard drive. If not you will need to make 
  the necessary adjustments to the path: ( -If:\YourCompiler'sDirectory\Include 
  etc.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Now right click in the Command 
  Prompt window and select Paste. Then hit Enter.<br>
  If all went well your program should compile without any errors. You should 
  find the newly created program called hello.exe in the Projects folder. To get 
  there, navigate up out of the Bin directory and down into the Projects directory 
  by<font color="#0000FF"> typing cd../projects</font>. Type <font color="#0000FF">dir</font> 
  and you should see your new program. To run it, type<br>
  <font color="#0000FF">hello</font><br>
  The program executes and prints the word Hello to the Command Prompt window. 
  Nothing spectacular, but congratulations! you're a programmer. Big whoop. Now 
  get back to work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">If your program didn't compile 
  successfully, proceed directly to <a href="../C%2B%2B%20Tutorial/Borland/debugging.htm">Debugging</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">First let's discuss how we 
  called the compiler and then we'll talk about our code. While at first glance 
  it looks like a long, intimidating string of complicated code, but the command 
  to the compiler is fairly simple when you break it down.<br>
  First we call the compiler:<br>
  bcc32<br>
  Remember earlier if we just call the compiler it prints out a list of commands? 
  If we call the compiler followed by various parameters, it will execute them. 
  Here we issue 3 parameters which tell the compiler where to find some necessary 
  files. Some are in the Include directory located at C:\Borland\BCC55\Include\, 
  some are in the Lib directory. ( -If for Include files -Lf for Library files 
  ) The path is given so the compiler knows where to find these files. The command 
  -n tells the compiler where to put the finished program: in the Projects directory 
  and lastly, the path to the source code itself is given: \Borland\BCC55\Projects\hello.cpp. 
  If you take away the long path info, it's not so intimidating. You can save 
  the command in a text file for later use. Enter <font color="#0000FF">notepad 
  compiler_commands.txt</font> into the Command Prompt. Paste the following shortcut:</font></p>
<table width="75%" border="1" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">bcc32 -If:\Borland\BCC55\Include 
      -Lf:\Borland\BCC55\Lib -n\Borland\BCC55\Projects \Borland\BCC55\Projects\.cpp 
      </font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Now when you want to compile 
  another program you can open the page, insert the name of the .cpp file, copy 
  and you're ready to paste into the command prompt and compile another program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Note that once your have entered 
  a few commands into the Command Prompt window, you can hit the up or down arrow 
  keys to recall any commands you already entered. So once you have compiled one 
  program and you want to compile another, you just arrow up till you find the 
  command from the previous compile. Using the left arrow key, scroll the blinking 
  cursor until it is underneath the period. Now hit the Backspace key to delete 
  the name of the previous file and enter the new one. <br>
