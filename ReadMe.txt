Welcome to AKA

Here you can find a selection of tutorials for Processing-JS which are layed out in a format suitable for offline viewing and editing. They are located in a folder called Processing-JS. 
To download the entire Archive, open the Processing-JS folder and click on the ZIP tab. The archive will automatically pack up into a Zip file and download to your default downloads folder. Simply UnZip the Archive into the folder of your choice and open the index.html file with your Web Browser.

The Programming4NE1 folder contains html based C#, C++ and Visual C++ tutorials aimed at no one in particular for my own personal use when I was learning those languages. Many of the download links etc. may be out of date. If anybody is using the tutorials and wants to send me current links I would be happy to update them.

The GameStudio folder contains Lite-C programs, not to be confused with Microsoft Game Studio. 
I promote the software because the Lite version is free. In fact I exclusively do tutorials using all free software and tools :)

The C# Tutorials folder contains One-Ups for C# and also tutorial programs saved as Visual C# files. Visual C# is also free to download from Microsoft :)

Also newly posted to AKA is the Talking Teddy Bear project. A collection of MP3s intended for use with an MP3 Player Teddy bear or interactive electronic device.
